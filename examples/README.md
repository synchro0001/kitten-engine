# Examples

This directory contains example games made with the kitten engine that also serve as a tour of its features. Each example contains a Gleam source file, a README that explains how you would write that game yourself, an HTML entrypoint file and the compiled code for the game, bundled with webpack. To test out the game, you can simply open the html file with a dev server. However, to modify the code and see the changes to the game, you will need to create a new gleam project and follow the instructions in the main README.

If you find a mistake in any of these examples, please do not hesitate to report it. All contributions are welcome.
